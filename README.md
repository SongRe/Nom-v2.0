# Nom-v2.0

Nom is a mobile android application that keeps track of the expiry dates of fresh produce, such as vegetables and fruit. Tailored towards college / University students that don't always have time to cook and often forget the contents of their fridge, Nom aims to prevent precious produce from going to waste.

# How-it-Works

Nom allows users to enter their own shopping list, item by item. It checks the new items against a database, and calcalates its expiration date. In the produce-basket section, users will be able to see their produce, as well as the expiration date relative to the system date.

# Upcoming Features

- Ability to parse produce from the scan of a receipt
- Ability to notify users of upcoming expiry dates
- Ability to delete current produce items at User's will
- Ability to automatically detect expiration on boot
